### Probability Frequency Distribution :

- **A Probability Frequency Distribution** is a table OR representation that shows 
    - **Possible values (OR Class Intervals)** of a random variable
    - **Corresponding Probabilities** of each value occuring
- **Probability Frequency Distribution** combines ideas from
    - **Frequency Distribution** (how often values occur)
    - **Probability** (Likelihood of Occurence)
