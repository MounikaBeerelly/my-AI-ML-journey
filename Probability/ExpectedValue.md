## Understanding the ceoncept of `Expected Value: EV` in Probability :
- The `Expected Value (EV)` of a random variable is the `Long-run average outcome` you would expect if an experiment is repeated many times.
- The `Expected Value (EV)` is also called **Mean, Expectation** OR **Mathematical Expectation**.

### Expected Value for a Discrete Random varible :
- If a random variable X takes values x1, x2, x3, ....., xn with corresponding probabilities pa, p2, p3, ...., pn, then
    - $E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i p_i$

- **Interpretation** : Multiply each value by its prabobility and add the results.
- Expected Value for a Continuous Random Variable 
    - $E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x)\, dx$

#### Properties of Expected Value :
1. Linearity
2. Sum of Random values
3. Expected value of a constant
4. Scaling

#### Why Expected Value Matters :
- Predicts the `average outcome` over many trials
- Helps compare different Strategies OR Decisions
- Essential in Statistics, Economics, Finance, and Data Science

### Trial :
- Single execution of the random experiment.
